# Hugo Blog Experiment

This repo is a sandbox for learning [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) — a lightning-fast static site generator written in Go — using the minimalist [Hermit-V2](https://github.com/1bl4z3r/hermit-V2) theme.

> ⚠️ This is not a live blog yet — just a personal experiment while learning Hugo and static site workflows.
