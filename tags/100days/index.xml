help people commit to something for 100 days and actually follow through.
The rules are simple:
Write down your 100-day commitment. Pick a start or end date. Decide if it’s private, public, or shared with the community. Put some skin in the game — tip from $2 to $147. That’s it. No feeds. No distractions. Just you versus the next 100 days.</description></item></channel></rss>
