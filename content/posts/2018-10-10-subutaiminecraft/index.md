## Why Subutai grabbed me

Subutaiâ„¢ is the first real **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Cloud Computing platform** Iâ€™d seen.  
Born out of a defense research project, it let anyone create a secure, distributed cloud using spare resources â€” not Amazonâ€™s, not Googleâ€™s, but yours.  

The idea of a **democratized cloud** felt ahead of its time, and I wanted in.

## My contribution: Minecraft hosting

Subutai apps are packaged as **Blueprints** â€” JSON templates you can share on the Bazaar marketplace.  
I wrote one for **Minecraft hosting**:

With it, anyone could spin up a Minecraft server inside their own P2P cloud in minutes. It wasnâ€™t just about gaming â€” it was a way to show that Subutai could power *everyday communities*, not just IoT or enterprise workloads.

## Running two nodes in Switzerland

I didnâ€™t just code it; I ran it. For two years I hosted **two Subutai nodes in Switzerland**, in different locations. One in my flat, another in a family memberâ€™s home.  

That gave me my own tiny but real **private cloud**, geo-separated and resilient enough to run the Minecraft world my son and his friends played in. It proved the point: with Subutai, ordinary people could build and control their own cloud.

## What it meant

Writing the Minecraft blueprint and hosting those nodes made decentralization personal. It wasnâ€™t theory â€” it was my hardware, my rules, my cloud.  

Thatâ€™s the future Iâ€™d still like to see: **clouds that belong to people, not just corporations.**
