Late in 2016 I dove into Ember.js and JavaScript to build the **Speed Comparison** client, a fun tool that lets you dig into the performance of websites with a slick, responsive interface. The client is an Ember app crafted during an 8 sincle week sprints, paired with a custom server component that handles data collection and serves up the numbers. It was a great learning curve, blending front-end frameworks with backend logic to visualize real-world performance metrics. The full project is available on GitHub, split between the **client** (Ember UI) and **server** (data provider), in case you want to poke through the code.
