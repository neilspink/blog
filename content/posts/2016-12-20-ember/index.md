Late in 2016 I dove into Ember.js and JavaScript to build the **Speed Comparison** projectâ€”a fun tool that measures and visualizes website performance. The work was structured as **eight weekly sprints**, giving me a chance to iterate quickly, experiment with features, and learn by doing. The **client** is an Ember.js application with a responsive UI, while the **server** component collects and serves up the performance data. Together they form a simple but effective way to explore how different sites stack up in terms of speed. It was a rewarding introduction to front-end frameworks and backend integration, and the code remains on GitHub as a snapshot of that learning journey.
